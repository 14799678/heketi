# Heketi
Heketi is a RESTful storage management framework which enables certain storage systems to be easily managed.  Heketi poses itself not an abstraction layer, but instead as a framework for developers to enhance their existing storage system management through a plugin interface.  Heketi also provides a RESTful interface which enables callers to easily manage the storage system.
